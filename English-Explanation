Code Structure:

    The application consists of a Windows Forms (WinForms) project.
    The main form (Form1) includes textboxes for user input, labels to display weather information, and a picture box to show the weather condition icon.

API Integration:

    The OpenWeather API is used to fetch weather data.
    The API key and the location are used to construct the API URL.
    The FetchAndDisplayWeatherInfo method sends a request to the API, retrieves the JSON response, and parses it to extract relevant information.

User Interface:

    Labels are initially hidden and become visible after fetching weather data.
    The weather information, including city name, temperature, and condition, is displayed in the corresponding labels.
    The weather condition icon is displayed in a PictureBox.

Exception Handling:

    The code includes exception handling to manage errors during API requests or data parsing.
    Error messages are displayed in a MessageBox in case of an exception.

Event Handling:

    The application responds to button clicks and updates triggered by textbox text changes.
    Both the "Search" button and the Enter key trigger the weather information update.

Instructions for Use:

    Enter the desired location in the textbox.
    Click the "Search" button or press Enter.
    Weather information, including city name, temperature, and condition, will be displayed.
